# Bank System

This repository enhances the simple bank system from [finance-manager-v2](https://github.com/nu1lspaxe/finance-manager-v2), which only supports basic user withdrawals and deposits and lacks security and advanced features.

This version introduces the following features:
- Database security, e.g., row level security, database access control, policies, etc.
- Query optimization with views, indexes, etc.
- Advanced features, e.g., transfer between accounts, interest, etc.
- Dynamic SQL generation with [Squirrel](https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel)
- With more powerful Postgres extensions, e.g., pg_cron, pgTAP, etc.
